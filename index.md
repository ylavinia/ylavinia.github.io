Hi, I'm Yukhe (pronounced "you-key"). I'm a software engineer with a background in machine learning and deep learning. I have done research on convolutional neural networks, computer vision, and the Internet of Things on 6LoWPAN. I am currently working as a software engineer building music school portal application.
